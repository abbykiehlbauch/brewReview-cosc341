Undergraduate Student 
In this step, you will implement your project. You need to build the Android app to 
the point so that users can test it. The implementation should include all four major 
tasks that you suggested in the previous steps. 

Build a vertical prototype. Build a vertical prototype that addresses all four major 
tasks identified in project step 3. This prototype should be functional: not only in that 
the interface appears correct but that the core functionality works the way that it is 
intended,  including  error  handling.  The  goal,  remember,  is  to  allow  someone  to 
understand  how  it  would  feel  about  interacting  with  the  system.  Also,  apply  the 
design principles that we discussed in lecture 5. 

Note:  We  are  not  interested,  for  example,  in  having  you  build  a  whole  back-end 
system w/  SQL  Server.  PLEASE  consult with  me  if  you  need further  information  on 
major tasks / how much functionality is appropriate (My office hours: Tuesday and 
Thursday  12:30  pm-1:30  pm.  If the time doesn’t work, send  me an email. I will 
schedule a meeting time outside my class/office hours).  

Conduct  a  heuristic  evaluation. You  will  conduct  a  heuristic  evaluation  of  your 
system.  Recruit  three  members  from  other  groups,  use  Nielsen’s  heuristics  to 
identify some aspect of the interface that violates one of the heuristics. Your goal is 
to  identify  major  problem  areas  of  your  interfaces  through  this  method,  what 
heuristic(s) have been violated to cause these problems, the severity of the problem, 
and to make recommendations on how to address them. 

Incorporate users' feedback: Implement the recommendations suggested by users 
in the heuristic evaluation phase. 

You will submit the following components in a pdf file (six pages max): 
• A brief description of your system explaining the major components/tasks of the 
system. Include a brief justification of the design changes for the tasks from the 
final paper prototype (i.e., project step 3). If there are no changes, please mention 
them accordingly.  
• A  brief  description  indicating  that  the  following  design  principles  are  applied:  
visibility,  feedback,  constraints,  consistency,  affordances,  simplicity,  matching, 
help. Also, include screenshots of the interfaces to show how the design principles 
are applied. Show at least two examples/screenshots for each design principle.  
• A summary of problems identified by each user, along with which heuristics were 
violated,  severity  and  users’  recommendation.  You  can  sort  these  in  terms  of 
severity, functional/conceptual area (i.e., in a way that makes sense with respect 
to your system), or each heuristic.  
• A summary of the changes that you have made based on the heuristic evaluation. 
• Video:  Create  a  video  showing  how  you  expect  your  system  to  be  used  for  the 
tasks. Upload the video to any video sharing site (e.g., YouTube) and share the link 
Include individual heuristic evaluation results in a separate pdf file. 

Deliverable:  
1. A report, six pages max, A4 paper, PDF format 
2. Another pdf file containing heuristic evaluations of individual users 
3. Source code: Upload a zip file containing the following folders: Code and APK. 
Code folder should include all the Android codes, and APK folder should only 
contain the .apk file  

Marking Guideline 
[35 marks] Prototype:  
• [12 marks] Vertical prototype of four major tasks (prototype should be functional. 
First  check  for  the  description  and  then  check  the  APK  to  see  the  prototype  in 
detail). Deduct up to  -12 if they are not major tasks. They should also include a 
video.  
• [8  marks]  Design  principles  are  applied  (e.g.,  visibility,  feedback,  constraints, 
consistency, affordances, simplicity, matching, provide help)   
• [6  marks]  A  summary  of  problems  identified,  with heuristics,  severity,  and 
recommendation 
• [3 marks] A discussion of design fixes in another iteration  
• [4 marks] Updated prototype based on the heuristic evaluation 
• [2 marks] Individual heuristic response in a separate file  
Other deductions: 
[-2] Submission instruction not followed (e.g., no apk or code)
