# Brew Review - A Brewery Passport
## Final Project for COSC341 - Human Computer Interaction

### Project Description
Our program is called Brew Review and it is designed for beer lovers in Kelowna. With this app, a user can discover and review new breweries and beer while keeping track of their favourite (and not so favourite) places to go.

 The four main components of the app are as follows. The user is able to add, edit, view, and delete reviews for breweries and beers. They can add and view the reviews through the brewery page, and delete and edit reviews through their user profile. They are also able to search the breweries in Kelowna and view their menu through the app.

 Finally, they are able to see all of their reviews (of beers and breweries) centralized in their user profile. This acts as a passport, allowing users to see their favourite breweries and beers, and what ones they shouldnâ€™t try again.
